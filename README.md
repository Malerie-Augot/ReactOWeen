# Sem2-Sprint1
Website created for software development program assignment.

Assignment Instructions:
The basic requirements for the Sprint are as follows:
· The website must have at least 3 separate pages/components including App.js if you’re using react, or including index.html if you’re using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you’re using React, since we have not directly covered linking between react pages/components, you can call other two components on the App.js (obviously there are better ways to do that – but right now taking into consideration the level of discussion we’ve had so far)
· Each page must implement styling using external CSS files for most part. If you’re using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the same is true for your .js files, they should be external for the most part. If you’re using React, recall that you can apply some common styles in “index.css”. And if preferred, make your own external style
sheet- import it and use it in any pages you like.
· It is required that your styling implements Flexbox and Media queries to make as much responsive as possible. [test with different device options in inspector before submission]
· The manipulation of the DOM with JavaScript is highly encouraged. Use your imagination and try to come up with some nice manipulations of html pages through JS function calls [This will be a good place to show your JS function skills]
· You must submit a Figma mock-up for your designs

Some key notes to keep in mind for this project is a good use of HTML5 semantic tags (Which is pivotal for accessibility purposes) [do validate your html before submission – remember no RED elements in your HTML], organization of your code (as it should be easy to tell what is where), and layout/colour choice of the pages (A pleasant design is an important aspect. A simple colour wheel or hex picker can be a powerful tool!).
